# Regulatory Data Repository 

This Data Repository consolidates public data on federal rulemakings that are frequently used in research related to regulation. The purpose of this repository is to provide clean, organized, and comprehensive data to facilitate research on regulation.

This repository will be complemented and updated routinely.

The current version of the repository contains the following data sets:


## 1. Unified Agenda Data

This data set contains data for all rulemakings published in the semiannual [Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain) since Fall 1995. It includes most of the information you would find on a Unified Agenda page (for example, [RIN 2060-AN53](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200604&RIN=2060-AN53)), including RIN, rule title, abstract, agency, priority category (economically significant, significant, etc.), RIN status, rule stage, CFR citation, legal authority, and timetable (i.e., action, data, and FR citation).
